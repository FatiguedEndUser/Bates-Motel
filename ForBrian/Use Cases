****Version 1 (Basic): Hotel Management System: Standard Use Cases****

Use Case 1 (First Feature to Implement): User Registration & Login
1. User: Customer (Guest/Unregistered user becoming a Registered user)
     °Description:
        > A guest visits the website, creates an account by entering personal details (name, email, password, etc.), then logs 
           in. This is necessary before accessing booking, loyalty, or payment features.

   °Reason to Implement First:
        > Registration and login are foundational features that unlock most of the other user-specific functionality.


Use Case 2: Book a Room
2. User: Customer (Registered user)
     °Description:
        > A registered customer searches available rooms for specified dates, selects a room type, and completes the reservation (potentially using loyalty points or standard payment).


Use Case 3: Payment Processing
3. User: Customer, Clerk (sometimes Manager)
     °Description:
        > A customer or clerk (on behalf of the customer) reviews the booking costs, selects a payment method (credit card, 
          loyalty points, or both), and finalizes payment.
        > The system confirms the payment and updates the booking status.


Use Case 4: Loyalty Program Management
4. User: Customer, Manager (for adjustments)
     °Description:
        > A customer earns points for each booking or additional service.
        > They can view their points balance and redeem them for discounts or room upgrades.
        > Manager can make manual adjustments if there’s an error.


Use Case 5: Online Check-In
5. User: Customer
     °Description:
         > A customer completes an online “pre-check-in,” providing necessary information and confirming arrival time. This 
           helps streamline on-site check-in or if a clerk is unavailable.


Use Case 6: Manager Views Bookings
6. User: Admin/Manager
     °Description:
         > The Manager logs into the system and sees a dashboard of current, upcoming, and past reservations.
         > They can filter by date, room type, or customer name, and take actions like canceling or modifying reservations if 
           needed.


Use Case 7: Manager Manages Employee Accounts
7. User: Admin/Manager
     °Description:
         > The Manager can create or delete employee accounts, update roles (e.g., Clerk, Housekeeping, Valet), and ensure 
           access privileges are properly assigned.
         > If an employee quits or is fired, the Manager removes them from the system or sets an end date.


Use Case 8: Manager Approves/Rejects Employee PTO
8. User: Admin/Manager
     °Description:
         > An employee submits a PTO request through their employee account.
         > The Manager reviews the request, checks scheduling needs, and either approves or rejects it.
         > The system updates the employee’s PTO balance and schedules accordingly.


Use Case 9: Employee Clock In/Out
9. User: Employee (Clerks, Housekeeping, Valet, Maintenance, etc.)
     °Description:
         > An employee logs into their account to start or end their shift.
         > The system records the timestamp and updates the employee’s timesheet.
         > Managers can view or adjust these if an error occurs.


Use Case 10: Employee Checks Bookings & Room Occupancy
10. User: Employee (Clerk, Housekeeping, e.g.)
      °Description:
         > An employee looks up current bookings to see which rooms are occupied or due to be checked in/out.
         > This helps coordinate check-ins, check-outs, housekeeping schedules, or maintenance tasks.


Use Case 11: Employee Manages Personal Account
11. User: Employee (any staff member)
      °Description:
         > The employee logs into their account.
         > They can view or update personal details (name, contact info, etc.), check available PTO, review their timesheet,  
           or access tax documentation.
       

Use Case 12: Employee Submits Maintenance/Service Requests
12. User: Employee (Housekeeping, Maintenance, Valet, etc.)
      °Description:
         > If an employee spots an issue (e.g., broken AC, plumbing problem), they submit a request in the system.
         > Maintenance employees or Managers see the request in their queue, assign it, and update status once completed.
